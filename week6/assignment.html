            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The QGIS documentation for the <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_georeferencer.html">georeferencer plugin</a>.</li>

            <h2>Part 1: Georeferencing with QGIS</h2>
            <p>Georeference an image of a map. If you don't have one in mind, use an urban renewal plan from <a href="http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#map=12/40.7400/-73.9461">Urban Reviewer</a> that has an image associated with it (eg, <a href="http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#map=16/40.7106/-73.9895&amp;plan=Two+Bridges">Two Bridges</a>) or look at <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/search/index?filters%5Btype%5D=cartographic&amp;keywords=#">the NYPL's digital collections, filtered to maps</a>.</p>
            <p>Georeference the image using QGIS. The result may not be absolutely perfect, but do get major landmarks to line up and most of the streets in line. Keep in mind that aerial imagery is often taken at an angle, so avoid using rooftops as control points.</p>
            <p>Submit a <strong>screenshot</strong> of the georeferenced image, semi-transparent, over a base layer of your choosing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 2: Open mapping</h2>
            <p>Make a map in QGIS of a topic of your choosing--ideally something related to your project.</p>
            <p>Use at least two datasets and any combination of the QGIS techniques we have covered so far in class. As usual, please use cartographic design principles and include map elements such as legends and data source attribution.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 3: Carto</h2>
            <p>Next week we will start looking at Carto. The New School has an agreement with the company that lets us give more space to students as needed. To take advantage of this, please create a login with your New School email address using <a href="https://thenewschool.carto.com/signup">this link</a> if you haven't already.</p>
            <p>If you already have a Carto account with your New School email address and the above link does not work as a result, please login to your existing account and change the email address associated with it, then try signing up again.</p>
            <p>You don't have to do anything else with Carto for now, we will start talking about it next week.</p>
