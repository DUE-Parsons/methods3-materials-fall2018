            <p>This week we talked about another way to unlock more geographic data (<em>geocoding</em>) and a few other ways to represent density using QGIS (<em>heat maps</em> and <em>hex bins</em>). Use this assignment to get familiar with heat maps&nbsp;<em>or</em> hex bins.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that <a title="Final Project Proposal" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1407316/assignments/6483424" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.newschool.edu/api/v1/courses/1407316/assignments/6483424" data-api-returntype="Assignment">your final project proposal</a> is also due October 1.</p>

            <h2>Visualizing many points</h2>
            <div style="background: #ddd; padding: 15px;">
                <p>Hi again map-maker,</p>
                <p>I know we've been asking you to do a lot lately, so I'm only asking for one map this time around. There are two aspects of the district we are trying to get a grasp on, but the issues are so large that we're not even sure where to start. Can you help us understand how dense the district is with one of these and how that density varies throughout the area?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AirBnB listings. I think you can find them at <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside Airbnb</a>.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35#Export">Street trees</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As usual, it would help to see some streets and other landmarks for context.</p>
                <p>Thank you!</p>
            </div>
            <p>Pick the <em>one</em> of the ways we've looked at mapping many points--heat maps or hex bins--to help your council member understand the density of <em>one</em> of these point datasets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside Airbnb</a> (scroll down to New York City and download <strong>listings.csv</strong>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35#Export">NYC Street Tree Census</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
            <p>Use a QGIS <strong>Print Layout</strong> to create <strong>one PDF or image</strong> of your map. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate. Refer to your sources as appropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
