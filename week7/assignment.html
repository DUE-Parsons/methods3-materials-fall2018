            <p>Be careful: many of the resources that exist for Carto use an older interface (CartoDB). Start with <a href="https://carto.com/learn/guides">the official guides</a> and post on the Google Group with questions.</p>

            <h2>Make a shareable map in Carto</h2>
            <p>Your boss the city council member is back at it again:</p>
            <div style="background: #ddd; padding: 15px;">
                <p>Hi map wizard,</p>
                <p>It's been a few weeks! We now have access to some kind of mapping website called Carto and I was wondering if you could put one of our maps from earlier in it. It's okay if the styles are a bit different, but I'd like to be able to share it online with constituents. Ideally I'd like to see the vehicle collisions near bike lanes or schools, but if there is a map you made for us that you think would work better here I'm open to it.</p>
                <p>Thanks!</p>
            </div>
            <p>Create a map in Carto using at least two layers of data. I suggest using the data from <a title="Assignment 4: QGIS, geoprocessing and joining" href="../week4/assignment.html">Assignment 4, part 1</a> as requested above, but if you no longer have the data you do not have to re-create it. If you are not working with the data from Assignment 4, I suggest using a layer of polygon data and a layer of point data.</p>
            <p>Share the map publicly and submit the link to your map.</p>
